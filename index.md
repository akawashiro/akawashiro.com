## Software and Hardware
- [jendeley](https://akawashiro.github.io/jendeley/)
jendeley is a JSON based document organizing software.
    - [Introduction article (in Japanese)](https://zenn.dev/a_kawashiro/articles/a2170f967f9508)
- [z3shape](https://github.com/akawashiro/z3shape)
z3shape infer shapes in ONNX file using Z3 SMT solver.
- [sold](https://github.com/akawashiro/sold)
sold is a linker software which links depending shared objects to a binary or a shared object.
    - [Presentation in kernelvm (in Japanese)](./sold_kernelvm_20211120.pdf)
    - [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6EMyVrq3jo)
- [kearch](https://github.com/kearch/kearch)
This is a distributed search engine made from scratch. There are
two type of search engine -- specialized and meta. A meta search
engine takes query from uses and distribute it to appropriate
specialized search engine.

    - [Demo movie in the final presenation (in Japanese)](https://youtu.be/tErMAEk8wLQ)
- [typed-egison](https://github.com/egison/typed-egison)
This is a type checker for Egison programming language. I
designed all typing rules for Egison and make type inferencer
for Egison with Haskell. You can use it from interpreter.
- [wavplayer](https://github.com/akawashiro/wavplayer)
This is a mini music player using ATMEGA168 and SD card. I
wrote FAT16 file system for ATMEGA168. Musics are stored in wav
files in the root directory.
- [cropass](https://github.com/akawashiro/cropass)
a password manager written in Go. I wrote this to use myself.
You can generate, add and lookup password records.
- [hinvader](https://github.com/akawashiro/hinvader)
This is a simple invader like game wirtten in Haskell. I used
GLUT to reder the screen.
- [ml2wasm](https://github.com/akawashiro/ml2wasm)
This is a compiler from ML like language (MinCaml) to WebAssembly.
- [N-body-simulation](https://github.com/akawashiro/N-body-simulation)
Toy n-body simulator.

## Publication
- [APLAS 2019](https://conf.researchr.org/home/aplas-2019)
A Dependently Typed Multi-Stage Calculus
This is a formal multistage calculus with dependent types. We design its type
system and prove type soundness.
